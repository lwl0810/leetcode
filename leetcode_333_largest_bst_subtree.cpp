Largest BST Subtree
Given a binary tree, find the largest subtree which is a Binary Search Tree (BST), 
where largest means subtree with largest number of nodes in it.
Note:
A subtree must include all of its descendants.
Here’s an example:
    10
    / \
   5  15
  / \   \ 
 1   8   7

The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one.
The return value is the subtree’s size, which is 3.
